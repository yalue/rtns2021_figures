Generating Data
---------------

This data was generated by running the included `striping_vs_not.py` script
while in the `hip_plugin_framework` base directory. The data was then copied
from `hip_plugin_framework/results` to this directory. Once again, this script
assumes you're on a Radeon VII GPU, as it hardcodes CU masks to use 60 total
CUs.

You'll also need to copy `1024_vs_256_evenly_partitioned.json` and
`1024_vs_256_unevenly_partitioned.json` from `../worst_case_experiment`. If you
need to re-generate those, then see the instructions in that directory.

Generating the LaTeX Table
--------------------------

After generating the data, run `python generate_table.py`. It will print the
LaTeX tabular data to stdout (it's still on you to set up `\begin{tabular}`,
etc.).
