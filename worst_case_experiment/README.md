Generating Data
---------------

This data was generated by running the included the `worst_case_experiment.py`
script while in the `hip_plugin_framework` base directory, then copying the
resulting JSON data from `hip_plugin_framework/results`. This script assumes
that you're on a Radeon VII, with 60 CUs (as the CU masks it uses are for 60-
CU GPUs).

If the script ever hangs, then it can be resumed from the same experiment using
the `--start_experiment` command line flag.

Generating the plots and LaTeX table
------------------------------------

After generating the data, run `python generate_plots_and_table.py`. It was
copied from `hip_plugin_framework/scripts/view_times_cdf.py`, but modified
fairly heavily to be specific to the data in this directory.
